# CompSci3 Notes<hr>Hyper Text Markup Language/Cascading Style Sheets/JavaScript Website Building

Welcome! These are personal notes that intend to not only educate, but entertain as well. <br>
I am hardwired to rewrite notes, and I enjoy doing so as if I am teaching it myself. Thus, this repository of ASCII and intellect was born.

### <br><strong><ins>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING NOTICES!</ins></strong><br>

1. Firstly, I **highly** recommend you read the *"Array of Rules"* <ins>(ArrayOfRules.html), where indicators, phrasing, content division, and anything requiring context will be named</ins>. This is a seperate file to declutter this file alongside allowing for later additions/amends. 

2. This README file is a markdown file to catch the eye. This file is the only file in this repository that possesses a file type that is not one of the few (three) I will teach. Because of this fact, heed no mind to the contents of the raw file. I cannot fathom the fact that I learned markdown for this alone.

3. Let it be said that while these notes are seemingly worded with the expectation of public availability, these <ins>notes were solely meant for my own use</ins> at the end of the day. Even so, amnesia is always a possibility, so these *notes are written under the assumption that the reader possesses **minimal understanding** of the covered languages*.

4. As none can stop the flow of time, *these notes might become less accurate if WHATWG/W3C/TC39 decides to update* (i.e. screw over via syntax depreciation) *HTML/CSS/JS syntax/formatting respectively*. If some huge change occurs with one of the languages <ins>after 2026, anticipate the ommision of any features or fixes that might have come with that update; similarly, it is best to verify which updates removed functionality for revamped syntax/function rules</ins>. **(The rest is a rant.)** As seen from Unity's breaking changes with each update, any programming company *will* induce an upheaval for the following reasons:
    <ol>
      <li>The thought that it would be an excellent move for company stocks/profits</li>
      <li>It will cut costs either through sunsetting a server (like an unpopular service/feature), or by simplifying/shortening a way to arrive at/achieve a specific result</li>
      <li>The desire to promote or emphasize another service or feature</li>
      <li>As a preventive measure from any exploitation of with the content in question, whether that risks legal or security issue</li>
      <li>"Because we hate our community lmao"</li>
      <li>(Insert shaky CEO excuse here)</li>
    </ol>
    
    For a reference on how far tech companies are willing to cause inconvenience for foolish reasons, please see <a href="https://pseudodistant.dev/unsupported.php" target="_blank">Fumo YouTuber PsuedoDistant's rant</a> as well (might have to open in new tab, markdown files can straight up ignore styling within nested attribute tags).

5. The ASCII art will not work for some users, and ASCII from the raw code might appear closer to modern abstract art than ASCII. This is hardly important, as the art will never contain important information that cannot be sourced elsewhere within the notes. The ASCII art has also been adjusted to not interfere with information flow, so ignore it if anything may look like visual a(expletive).

Most of the info here came from O-C-A's Computer Science III course from 2025-2026, but I have added additional info because a course never covers everything that a coder might use. This will not either, just more than a course would ordinarily cover. I created the original in GitHub, but that version had my instructor's name displayed in the commits before permission was obtained. Incidentally, this repository was also created in GitHub, and can be found <a href="https://github.com/BerryhillCoding/CompSci3_Notes_-_HTML.Websites" target="_blank">here</a>.
