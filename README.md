# CompSci3 Notes<hr>Hyper Text Markup Language/Cascading Style Sheets/JavaScript Website Building

Welcome! These are personal notes that intend to not only educate, but entertain as well. <br>
I am hardwired to rewrite notes, and I enjoy doing so as if I am teaching it myself. Thus, this repository of ASCII and intellect was born. <br>
### <br><strong><ins>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING NOTICES!</ins></strong><br>
1. Firstly, I **highly** recommend you read the *"Array of Rules"* <ins>(ArrayOfRules.md), where indicators, phrasing, content division, and anything requiring context will be named</ins>. This is a seperate file to declutter this file alongside allowing for later additions/amends. 
2. This README file is a markdown file to catch the eye. This file is the only file in this repository that possesses a file type that is not one of the few (three) I will teach. Because of this fact, heed no mind to the contents of the raw file. I cannot fathom the fact that I learned markdown for this alone.
3. Let it be said that while these notes are seemingly worded with the expectation of public availability, these <ins>notes were solely meant for my own use</ins> at the end of the day. Even so, amnesia is always a possibility, so these *notes are written under the assumption that the reader possesses **minimal understanding** of the covered languages*.
4. As none can stop the flow of time, *these notes might become less accurate if WHATWG/W3C/TC39 decides to update* (i.e. screw over via syntax depreciation) *HTML/CSS/JS syntax/formatting respectively*. If some huge change occurs with one of the languages <ins>after 2026, anticipate the ommision of any features or fixes that might have come with that update; similarly, it is best to verify which updates removed functionality for revamped syntax/function rules</ins>. **(The rest is a rant.)** As seen from Unity's breaking changes with each update, any programming company *will* induce an upheaval for the following reasons:
    <ol>
      <li>The thought that it would be an excellent move for company stocks/profits</li>
      <li>It will cut costs either through sunsetting a server (like an unpopular service/feature), or by simplifying/shortening a way to arrive at/achieve a specific result</li>
      <li>The desire to promote or emphasize another service or feature</li>
      <li>As a preventive measure from any exploitation of with the content in question, whether that risks legal or security issue</li>
      <li>"Because we hate our community lmao"</li>
      <li>(Insert shaky CEO excuse here)</li>
    </ol>
    For a reference on how far tech companies are willing to cause inconvenience for foolish reasons, please see <a href="https://pseudodistant.dev/unsupported.php" target="_blank">Fumo YouTuber PsuedoDistant's rant</a> as well (might have to open in new tab, markdown files can straight up ignore styling within nested attribute tags).

Most of the info here came from O C-A's Computer Science III course from 2025-2026, but I have added additional info because a course never covers everything that a coder might use. This will not either, just more than a course would ordinarily cover. I created the original in GitHub,
